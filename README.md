# IRIS

iris-plot is a tool written in MATLAB to visualize the gain of function or the loss of function in terms of the p-value 
from the two-sample unpaired t-test performed upon the patient and control data.

## Instructions to Use

### Using the IRIS Plots

1. Save the the patient and control data in separate sheets of the same excel file and provide them unique names 
(eg : patient1, ctrl1, patient2, ctrl2...)
2. In the MATLAB command window, type run_multi_iris_plot and hit Enter. (or run the 'run_multi_iris_plot.m' MATLAB file)
3. Specify the number of rings to be included in the iris plot. (maximum is eight)
4. Select the excel sheet containing the data.
5. Specify the sheet names for the patient and control in the dialog box that appears and hit OK.
6. For the iris plot with the direction (increment or decrement) you have to specify the type of sample statistic 
(mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, median) that you wish to compare.

After this the iris-plots would be generated and displayed. The innermost ring would correspond to the first patient/control comparison. (In the case of DIVs, the innermost ring would correspond to the first DIV). Each segment of a ring corresponds to a parameter and the color of the segment indicates the level of significance and the gain/loss nature when the two samples are tested in terms of the considered parameter. 

Some of the sample iris plots generated by the tool are shown below.

### Using Power Plots and Normality Plots

1. Save the the patient and control data in separate sheets of the same excel file and provide them unique names 
(eg : patient1, ctrl1, patient2, ctrl2...)
2. In the MATLAB command window, type pwr_main and hit Enter. (or run the 'pwr_main.m' MATLAB file)
3. Specify the number of rings to be included in the iris plot.(maximum is eight)
4. Select the excel sheet containing the data.
5. Specify the sheet names for the patient and control in the dialog box that appears and hit OK.
6. For the iris plot with the direction (increment or decrement) you have to specify the type of sample statistic 
(mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, median) that you wish to compare.

After this the power-plots and normality plots would be generated and displayed. The innermost ring would correspond to the first patient/control comparison. (In the case of DIVs, the innermost ring would correspond to the first DIV). 

The normality plot indicates whether the two samples under testing are approximately normally distributed. The innermost ring would correspond to the first patient/control comparison. (In the case of DIVs, the innermost ring would correspond to the first DIV). Each segment of a ring corresponds to a parameter and the color of the segment indicates whether the two samples are approximately normally distributed or not in terms of the considered parameter. If the color is green then the two samples are approximately normal. If the color is red, then the two samples are not approximately normal and hence the t-test would most likely be not appicable. For the testing of normality, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used. 

A normality plot generated by the tool is shown below.

The power plot indicates the power level of the t-tests that are conducted for comparing two samples in terms of a given parameter. When calculating power, the population means and variances are estimated using the sample statistics. When computing the power level, the normality is assumed for all samples. Each segment of a ring corresponds to a parameter and the color of the segment indicates the power level of the t-test carried out for the two samples in terms of the considered parameter.
