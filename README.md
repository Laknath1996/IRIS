# IRIS

iris-plot is a tool written in MATLAB to visualize the gain of function or the loss of function in terms of the p-value 
from the two-sample unpaired t-test performed upon the patient and control data.

## Instructions to Use

1. Save the the patient and control data in separate sheets of the same excel file and provide them unique names 
(eg : patient1, ctrl1, patient2, ctrl2...)
2. In the MATLAB command window, type run_multi_iris_plot and hit Enter.
3. Specify the number of rings to be included in the iris plot.
4. Select the excel sheet containing the data.
4. Specify the sheet names for the patient and control in the dialog box that appears and hit OK.
5. For the iris plot with the direction (increment or decrement) you have to specify the type of sample statistic 
(mean, harmonic mean, geometric mean, median) that you wish to compare.

After this the iris-plots would be generated and displayed.
Some of the sample iris plots generated by the tool are shown below.
